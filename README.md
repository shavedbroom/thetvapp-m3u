# TheTVApp M3U Playlist

Since the playlist is dynamically generated, we recommend setting your application to reimport the playlist every 8 hours to ensure it remains up-to-date. If you encounter a 403 error, it indicates that your playlist has expired and needs to be refreshed. Both the playlist and EPG data are updated twice daily, so it's best to sync your playlist and guide information at the same time within your IPTV application. If you see "No information" displayed in the sports section of the guide, manually refreshing the EPG should resolve the issue and load the latest data.

## Rate Limit Information

There is a limit of **5 playlist requests in 2 hours**.
