# TheTVApp M3U Playlist

Since the playlist is dynamically generated, we recommend setting your application to reimport the playlist every 8 hours to ensure it remains up-to-date. If you encounter a 403 error, it indicates that your playlist has expired and needs to be refreshed. Both the playlist and EPG data are updated twice daily, so it's best to sync your playlist and guide information at the same time within your IPTV application. If you see "No information" displayed in the sports section of the guide, manually refreshing the EPG should resolve the issue and load the latest data.

## Rate Limit Information

**Note**: There is a limit of 5 playlist requests per IP address within a 2-hour window.

The rate limit applies per IP address. This means that from a single location, you can request the playlist up to 5 times within 2 hours. After reaching the limit, additional requests will be blocked for the following 2 hours. However, you can easily set up 5 or more devices from your location with a refresh interval of 8 hours, and still remain comfortably within the rate limit.
